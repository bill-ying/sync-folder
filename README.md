# sync-folder

**sync-folder** is a Python utility for one-way synchronization of two folders. New and updated files from a source folder are copied to a target folder. If a file is deleted from the source, it is moved (with its folder structure preserved) to a `Deleted` folder inside the target.

## Features

- One-way sync: source â†’ target
- Only copies files that are new or have changed (using SHA-256 hash comparison
- Moves files deleted from source to a `Deleted` folder in the target, preserving directory structure
- Rotating log files for sync operations 

## Special Note: Network Drive Metadata Restrictions

This program is designed to work with network drives that do **not** allow copying file metadata (such as timestamps or permissions).  
It only copies file content, ensuring compatibility with drives that restrict metadata operations.

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- No external dependencies

### Example

```bash
python main.py /path/to/source /path/to/target /path/to/logs
